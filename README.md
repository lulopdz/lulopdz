Hi, I'm Luis.

I have a strong passion for power systems and all aspects related to the field. I’m currently expanding my expertise in power system analysis and optimization. I’m open to collaborating on projects, research, and any initiatives that aim to advance this domain.

Feel free to reach out via direct messages or by email at lulopdz@gmail.com. Let’s connect and explore opportunities in power systems together!
